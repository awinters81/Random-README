### ___Full User Story:___ <br>

AS A developer<br>
I WANT a README generator<br>
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project<br>
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input<br>
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository<br>
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions<br>
WHEN I enter my project title<br>
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README<br>
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions<br>
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests<br>
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options<br>
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under<br>
WHEN I enter my GitHub username<br>
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile<br>
WHEN I enter my email address<br>
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions<br>
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents<br>
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README<br>
